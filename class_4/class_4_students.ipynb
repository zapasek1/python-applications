    "The resources in a RESTful API are typically represented by URIs (Uniform Resource Identifiers), and each resource has a state that can be retrieved, modified, or deleted using the appropriate HTTP method. The responses from a RESTful API are usually in a format such as JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) or XML (Extensible Markup Language).\n",

    "In addition to the basic HTTP methods, RESTful APIs can also support other HTTP features such as content negotiation, caching, and authentication. Content negotiation allows the client and server to agree on the format of the response data, while caching reduces the need for repeated requests to the server. Authentication provides a secure way to restrict access to the API. \n",
